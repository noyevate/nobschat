# nobschat

A new Flutter project.

Nobschat is a real-time chat application built with Flutter, following Clean Architecture to ensure modularity, testability, and scalability. The app uses Bloc for reactive and predictable state management, promoting clear separation of concerns.

On the backend, a Node.js server handles core logic and messaging APIs, with MongoDB as the database to store user data and messages. Real-time communication is enabled using WebSockets, providing fast, seamless messaging between users.

#Key Technologies:
